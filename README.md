# Big City Custom Kitties

A simple BepInEx plugin to allow custom textures and eye colors to be loaded into: Little Kitty Big City for customizing the player cat. 

--------------------------------
### Requirements:
- BepInEx (https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.1)
--------------------------------
### How to use:

Place a *png* into the "Skins" folder of your game install named "Current"

Please ensure any reskin's resolution is: 2048 x 2048 pixels

Edit the EyeColors.txt file with your own hex codes to recolor your eyes

--------------------------------
### Misc notes:

You can press F1 in game to reload texture & colors at any time. Useful to testing.

additional textures are included in the "Skins/extras" folder and belong to other cats in the world, 
though some have visual issues when applied to the player.

"extras/PaintingMesh.fbx" is an unrigged model of the player cat for use in making your own textures.

The default texture & eye colors match the original appearance. Don't let that confuse you when first testing the mod.
