Please ensure any skin replacement is a png named "Current" and is 2048x2048 pixels

You can press F1 in game to reload texture & colors at any time. Useful to testing.

=Misc=
Additional textures in the "extras" folder belong to other cats in the world, 
some have been edited to work when applied to the player, but not all have, some may look odd.

"extras/PaintingMesh.fbx" is an unrigged model of the player cat for use in making your own textures.

Enjoy :)
